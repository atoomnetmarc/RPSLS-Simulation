## What is this?

A mesmerizing, emergent simulation inspired by Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS). Watch as animated emoji entities 🪨📄✂️🦎🖖 flock together, compete, and convert each other based on the classic game rules.

## What you'll see

- **Entities** moving and bouncing with flocking behavior
- **Collisions** where winners convert losers to their type
- **Groups** forming, splitting, and competing
- **Real-time graph** showing population dynamics over time
- **Colorful effects** - sparks, trails, and glowing entities
